		<h1>WebSocket Example in Wasm</h1>

		<!--
			This is the JS generated by the `wasm-pack` build command

			The script here will define a `wasm_bindgen` global where all
			functionality can be accessed such as instantiation and the actual
			functions (examples below).

			You can customize the name of the file here with the `out-name` CLI flag
			to `wasm-bindgen`. You can also customize the name of the global exported
			here with the `no-modules-global` flag.
		-->
		<script src='pkg/wasm_websocket_example.js'></script>

		<script>

			// Import functionality from the wasm module, but note that it's not quite
			// ready to be used just yet.
			//
			const {} = wasm_bindgen;

			async function run()
			{
				// First up we need to actually load the wasm file, so we use the
				// exported global to inform it where the wasm file is located on the
				// server, and then we wait on the returned promise to wait for the
				// wasm to be loaded.
				//
				// Note that instead of a string here you can also pass in an instance
				// of `WebAssembly.Module` which allows you to compile your own module.
				//
				await wasm_bindgen( 'pkg/wasm_websocket_example_bg.wasm' );

				// And afterwards we can use all the functionality defined in wasm.
				//
				// const result = add( 1, 2 );

				// console.log( `1 + 2 = ${result}` );

				// if( result !== 3 )

				// 	throw new Error( "wasm addition doesn't work!" );
